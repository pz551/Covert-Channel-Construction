Covert Timing Channels

Given a source principal that is purportedly isolated from a destination principal, a covert timing channel is a means by which the source principal conveys information to the destination principal by using mechanisms in ways not intended for performing communications:
-The source principal signals a value by controlling the timing of one or more events.
-The destination principal detects a value by measuring the timing of one or more events.
Note, the events used by the source principal to signal a value might be different from the events used by the destination to detect that value.
